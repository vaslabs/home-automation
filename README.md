## How to start
## Setup
If you are on gnome you can add a .local/autostart entry to get the script running on login.

You need a dedicated SQS for reading from the machine you are running this script from, which is meant to 
contain alexa intents.

Use the provided .config/autostart and .local/bin to setup your startup.
